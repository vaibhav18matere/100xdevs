### History
- Our machines understands binary (0 and 1), earlier we used to write code in 'assembly language' that is 0 and 1.
- It's pretty hard; Now, we write it in "high level language" and compiler convert it into 0 and 1.
- Javascript built as a scripting language for web browser.
- You can write your own browser, just follow ECMA standards.

### Backend
- NODE.JS => Not language, No Framework; It's JS runtime; Engine for chrome.

#### Problems
- 1. print name and age
```js
var users = [
     {
          name: "Vaibhav",
          age: 26,

     },
     {
          name: "Arjun",
          age: 6,

     },
];
```
- print count from 0 to 100
